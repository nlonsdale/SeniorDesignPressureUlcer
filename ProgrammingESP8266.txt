Programming ESP8266 using an Arduino

Connect....
-------------------------
ESP8266      ||  Arduino
-------------------------
Tx           -->   Tx
Rx           -->   Rx
Ground       --> Ground
VCC & CH_PD  -->  3.3V
-------------------------

1. Upload a blank sketch to the Arduino
2. Open up the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE
3. Make sure line ending is set to "Both NL+CR"
4. Check the Baud Rate and set it to the Baud rate of the ESP8266
   (usually at 115200)
5. To see if ESP8266 is responding type "AT" and the monitor should
display "OK" -Note commands are case sensitive
6. To see available WIFI networks use the command AT+CWLAP
7. To connect to a WIFI network use the command AT+CWJAP="WIFI name",
"WIFI password" once completed the monitor will display "WIFI CONNECTED"
